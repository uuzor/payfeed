### 📱 AI UI/UX Prompt — React Native Mobile App (BasePay Streaming)

> **Prompt:**
>
> Design a **mobile-first UI/UX** for a **React Native app** that lets users stream crypto payments using **BasePay** and **Base Account** on the **Base blockchain**. The app supports the following experiences:
>
> 1. **Allowance Manager** – Parents stream USDC to kids with controls for daily/weekly limits, pause/resume, and allowance tracking.
> 2. **Crypto Donation Hub** – Users stream micro-donations to verified causes. Includes leaderboards, badges, and donation stats.
> 3. **Savings Goals Tracker** – Users set goals (e.g., "Buy Laptop"), stream funds toward them, and view animated progress.

> ### 🧑‍💻 App Platform:
>
> * Built in **React Native**, supporting both iOS and Android.
> * Layouts should use native-friendly components (e.g., `FlatList`, `ScrollView`, `TouchableOpacity`, `BottomSheet`, etc.).
> * Follow mobile UI best practices: large touch targets, clear typography, and responsive scaling.

> ### 🔥 Style & Design Language:
>
> * **Modern, fluid design** with smooth transitions using Reanimated or native `LayoutAnimation`.
> * Rounded corners (lg/2xl), soft shadows, and card-based sections.
> * Color theme: pastel blues and purples with dark mode/light mode support.
> * Fonts: “Inter”, “Space Grotesk”, or mobile-optimized system sans-serif.
> * Support haptics on actions like stream start/pause.

Would you like me to:

* Scaffold this into a real React Native layout with `react-navigation` and screens?
* Provide component wireframes or TailwindCSS for RN (e.g., using `tailwind-rn`)?
* Create a working demo in Expo?

Let me know how hands-on you want to go!
