App uses wallet stream history to determine access.

All logic off-chain — just wallet signature and stream verification. and add 2. Allowance App for Parents & Kids
Parent streams USDC (or ETH) to child’s Base Account using BasePay.

UI shows balance, upcoming streams, pause/resume button.

App tracks allowance behavior and gives spending insights.
3. Gasless Donation Platform
Users can support causes by streaming micro-donations via BasePay.

Causes are just regular smart wallets (Base Accounts).

No contracts needed — donations tracked off-chain via stream metadata (sender, cause, amount).

Add leaderboards, badges, or matching donations via backend logic.No on-chain approvals; parent is always in control via streaming control.

Bonus: Add chores/tasks off-chain to gamify it.5. Crypto Saving Goals Tracker
Users create “goals” in-app (e.g., save 0.5 ETH for a laptop). Proof-of-Pay Feed (Like Farcaster for Paid Users)
Users who stream payments to a community wallet get access to a “feed” or messaging app.

App uses wallet stream history to determine access.

All logic off-chain — just wallet signature and stream verification., generate a code level explaination of how all these will work in the base pay
Use BasePay to stream to their own Base Account over time.

App visualizes progress, sends reminders, etc.

No smart contracts — just payments + off-chain logic.💸 2. INITIATE STREAM USING BASEPAY
ts
Copy
Edit
import { createStream } from "@basepay/sdk";

const stream = await createStream({
chainId: 8453, // Base mainnet
tokenAddress: "0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606e48", // USDC
sender: smartAccount.getAddress(),
receiver: "0xChildOrCauseAddress",
amountPerSecond: ethers.utils.parseUnits("0.000001", 6), // USDC per sec
startTime: Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000),
endTime: Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000) + 30 * 24 * 60 * 60, // 30 days
});
✅ You now have a live stream! The funds flow without needing new contracts.

🧑‍👧 USE CASE 1: Allowance App (Parent → Child)
🔁 Stream USDC
As above, parent streams to the child’s Base Account.

🔎 Track allowance
Poll or subscribe to BasePay's stream status:

ts
Copy
Edit
import { getStreamsBySender } from "@basepay/sdk";

const streams = await getStreamsBySender({
sender: parentAddress,
});
🕹️ Pause / Resume
ts
Copy
Edit
await pauseStream({ streamId: "0x123..." });
await resumeStream({ streamId: "0x123..." });
📊 Off-chain Enhancements
Track:

How often child spends

Remaining allowance

Chore completion (stored in Firebase, Supabase, etc.)

💖 USE CASE 2: Gasless Donation Platform
Each cause has a Base Account address.

Donors stream funds via BasePay (same pattern).

Your backend/indexer tracks:

json
Copy
Edit
{
"sender": "0xDonorAddress",
"cause": "0xCauseAddress",
"amountPerSecond": "0.000005",
"start": "...",
"end": "..."
}
Render: leaderboards, top donors, badges.

💰 USE CASE 3: Crypto Saving Goals Tracker
Each user streams to their own wallet (self-directed DCA).

Create goal off-chain json Copy Edit { "goalName": "Laptop", "targetAmount": "0.5 ETH", "deadline": "2025-12-31", "streamId": "0x..." }
Visualize progress Use BasePay to fetch stream stats and compute:
ts
Copy
Edit
const balanceStreamed = (now - startTime) * amountPerSecond;
Show progress bar:

ts
Copy
Edit
const percent = (balanceStreamed / targetAmount) * 100;
📢 USE CASE 4: Proof-of-Pay Feed
Community has a wallet: 0xCommunityWallet

Users who are actively streaming to that wallet get access to gated features

🔐 Example check:
ts
Copy
Edit
const streams = await getStreamsBySender({ sender: userAddress });
const isActive = streams.some(
(s) => s.receiver === "0xCommunityWallet" && s.active === true
);
if (isActive) {
// show content
}
No need for token gating or smart contract logic — streaming is the "proof."
